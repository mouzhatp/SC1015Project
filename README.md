# SC1015 W132 Group 2 Project: Analysis of Earthquake Characteristics and Predictive Factors for Magnitude

### Earthquake Data from Kaggle

### Datasets info
title: title name given to the earthquake.

magnitude: The magnitude of the earthquake

date_time: date and time

cdi: The maximum reported intensity for the event range

mmi: The maximum estimated instrumental intensity for the event

alert: The alert level - “green”, “yellow”, “orange”, and “red”

tsunami: "1" for events in oceanic regions and "0" otherwise

sig: A number describing how significant the event is. Larger numbers indicate a more significant event. This value is determined on a number of factors, including: magnitude, maximum MMI, felt reports, and estimated impact

latitude / longitude: coordinate system by means of which the position or location of any place on Earth's surface can be determined and described

We used 782 earthquake data which has Richter magnitude >=6.5 from 2001/1/1 to 2023/1/1.
